The Terrapin was developed near the end of the 28th century to serve as the first ship in the Empire’s defensive restructuring of the Navy. The Terrapin’s watchword is protection, with extensive shield systems and armor layers designed to provide the maximum possible defense for pilot and crew. While it lacks the maneuverability of a dedicated fighter, it does maintain an advanced, hard-hitting array of weapons intended to keep the most fearsome Vanduul raider at bay.","description_cn":"制造商：铁砧航天(Anvil Aerospace)\r\n定位： 探路者\r\n向您呈现铁砧航天U4A-3水龟级扫描/探索船。水龟于28世纪末研发完成，作为帝国海军防御性重建的第一艘舰船。水龟侧重于防御性，装备有大量护盾系统以及多层装甲，意在为飞行员和船员提供最大的保护。虽然水龟不像战斗机一样有着优良的机动性，但是它仍配备有先进且强力的武器，让剜度侵略者们不敢轻易接近。","shop_buy":[{"min_buying_price":null,"max_selling_price":null,"current_price":2568100.0,"layout_name":"Stanton-ArcCorp-Area18-Astro Armada","layout_name_cn":"斯坦顿(Stanton)-弧光星(ArcCorp)-18区(Area18)-阿斯特罗无畏舰队","shop_inventory":100.0,"shop_max_inventory":100.0,"refresh_per_minute":1.0}],"shop_sell":[],"shop_rent":[],"file_name":"Data\\Libs\\Foundry\\Records\\Entities\\Spaceships\\ANVL_Terrapin.xml","json_path":"Data/Libs/Foundry/Records/Entities/Spaceships/ANVL_Terrapin.json"}
