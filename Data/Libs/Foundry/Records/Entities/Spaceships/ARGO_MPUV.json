Vast numbers of Argo Cargos are responsible for loading and unloading goods onto massive long-haul transports and miners that cannot otherwise land on planets or drydocks, such as the Hull D and the Orion. Some captains choose to own and operate their own Argo, while others pay privately owned ships operating as port services a rental fee for performing the unloading process.","description_cn":"制造商：南船座宇航(Argo Astronautics)\r\n定位：轻型货船\r\n南船座宇航的MPUV-1C又被称作MPUV-货运，它作为商人们的搬运工在星际间无处不在。大量的MPUV-货运被用来给无法降落在星球或者干船坞的长途运输的船装卸货物，例如货轮D和猎户座。有些船长会选择购买并使用自己的南船座宇航MPUV-货运，另一些人会去租用私人的MPUV-货运作为装卸货的港口服务。","shop_buy":[{"min_buying_price":null,"max_selling_price":null,"current_price":224200.0,"layout_name":"Stanton-Hurston-Lorville-NewDeal","layout_name_cn":"斯坦顿(Stanton)-赫斯顿(Hurston)-罗威尔(Lorville)-NewDeal","shop_inventory":100.0,"shop_max_inventory":100.0,"refresh_per_minute":1.0}],"shop_sell":[],"shop_rent":[],"file_name":"Data\\Libs\\Foundry\\Records\\Entities\\Spaceships\\ARGO_MPUV.xml","json_path":"Data/Libs/Foundry/Records/Entities/Spaceships/ARGO_MPUV.json"}
