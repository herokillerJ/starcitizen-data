The UEE Navy uses MPUV-1Ps extensively, and any new recruit can likely recall those terrifying moments in which such a ship carried them to their first space assignment. In civilian hands, Argo Personnel ships are adapted for everything from standard taxi services to use as makeshift combat dropships. The Argo MPUV-1P is capable of carrying up to eight humans and their equipment.","description_cn":"制造商：南船座宇航(Argo Astronautics)\r\n定位：人员运输\r\n南船座宇航MPUV-1P又被称作南船座载人，这款MPUV的职责非常简单而重要，那就是把一批人从一个地方运送到另一个地方。MPUV载人在UEE海军中被广泛地使用，任何一个新兵大概都能回忆起第一次乘坐MPUV载人去执行宇宙任务时的种种可怕瞬间。在平民手中，MPUV载人飞船几乎被应用到所有领域，无论是普通的出租车服务，还是凑合一下当作战斗登陆艇。MPUV载人飞船可以最多装载8个带有装备的人员。","shop_buy":[{"min_buying_price":null,"max_selling_price":null,"current_price":233000.0,"layout_name":"Stanton-Hurston-Lorville-NewDeal","layout_name_cn":"斯坦顿(Stanton)-赫斯顿(Hurston)-罗威尔(Lorville)-NewDeal","shop_inventory":100.0,"shop_max_inventory":100.0,"refresh_per_minute":1.0},{"min_buying_price":null,"max_selling_price":null,"current_price":233000.0,"layout_name":"Stanton-Aaron Halo-Delamar-Levski-TeachsShipShop","layout_name_cn":"斯坦顿(Stanton)-亚伦环-德拉玛(Delamar)-列夫斯基(Levski)-TeachsShipShop","shop_inventory":100.0,"shop_max_inventory":100.0,"refresh_per_minute":1.0}],"shop_sell":[],"shop_rent":[],"file_name":"Data\\Libs\\Foundry\\Records\\Entities\\Spaceships\\ARGO_MPUV_Transport.xml","json_path":"Data/Libs/Foundry/Records/Entities/Spaceships/ARGO_MPUV_Transport.json"}
